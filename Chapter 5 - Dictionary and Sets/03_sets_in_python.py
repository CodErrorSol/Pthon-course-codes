# Hence, SETS IS A COLLECTION OF NON-REPETITIVE ELEMENTS.

## There is no fix sequence in set, coz it uses the concept as Hash.
## And using Hash we want to improve the performance and want to fetch
## the elements as fast as possible.
## so we want speed over sequence here.

## So indexing is not possible in set.
# a[2]

b = {}
print(type(b))

## So sets does not support sequence and doesn't accept duplicate values and are immutable.
